![Introduction](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-Introduction.png)

This was my first time trying a whole webpage!
All the words are not enough to express how I feel about not only building a whole page from scratch, but also making it responsive for many screen widths!

![What I have learned](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-What-I-have-learned.png)

I won't lie, it took me a while, specially the responsive part, but it was also tremendous rewarding!
The best part is to know that I can do something big, and I will do even bigger things in the future. I am so glady happy!
