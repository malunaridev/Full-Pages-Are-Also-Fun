![What is this about?](assets/Readme-What-is-this.png)

This is a personal project where I build some full pages pages for fun. Similar to [Landing Pages Are Fun](https://github.com/malunaridev/Landing-Pages-Are-Fun), It helps me to learn new things, test new technologies and keep my portfolio growing everyday. All the pages examples were found on internet: none of them were designed by me. As my knowledge grow, I will keep coming back to old projects to apply new features and keep improving my skills. Why don't you take a look?
